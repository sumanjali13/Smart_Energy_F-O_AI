# Smart Energy Forecasting and Opitmization using AI
An AI-powered system to predict solar energy and provide intelligent suggestions to minimize waste and optimize usage in real time.
  In a world rapidly shifting to renewable sources, this project aims to tackle the issue of energy wastage and imbalance in solar power systems. Using machine learning, real-time weather data, and optimization logic, we: 
* Predict solar energy output using environmental factors  
* Provide suggestions to balance energy usage, storage, and supply.
* Help users and industries become more energy efficient

ðŸš€ Features
