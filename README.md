# Smart Energy Forecasting and Opitmization using AI
An AI-powered system to predict solar energy and provide intelligent suggestions to minimize waste and optimize usage in real time.
  In a world rapidly shifting to renewable sources, this project aims to tackle the issue of energy wastage and imbalance in solar power systems. Using machine learning, real-time weather data, and optimization logic, we: 
* Predict solar energy output using environmental factors  
* Provide suggestions to balance energy usage, storage, and supply.
* Help users and industries become more energy efficient

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time solar energy prediction using weather APIs
✅ Streamlit-powered interactive dashboard
✅ Energy optimization suggestions based on usage and battery data
✅ Modular design and expandable to any region/city
✅ Built-in model performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)

🧠 Tech Stack
Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)
Machine Learning: Random Forest Regressor (with optional LSTM upgrade)
Streamlit: for frontend dashboard
OpenWeatherMap API: real-time weather data
Joblib: model persistence

🌍 Future Enhancements
